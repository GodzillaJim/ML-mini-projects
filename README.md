# ML APPLICATIONS

This is a collection of ML projects built using Python following Data-Flair's guide. <br>
They include:<br>

> **1. Fake News Detector**
>
> > <P>This app tells whether news in a piece of article passed to it is FAKE or REAL. The model employs a TfidfVectorizer and a PassiveAggressiveClassifier using the dataset found <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1er9NJTLUA3qnRuyhfzuN0XUsoIC4a-_q/view'>here</a>. The dataset has four columns; id, title, text, and labels. This data was split into train and test data, and attained 92.7% accuracy.

> **2. Parkinson's Disease Predictor**
>
> > <p>This project builds a model for detecting Parkinson's disease in an oblivious patient using the data found <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/parkinsons/'>here</a></p>

> **3. Color Detector**
>
> > <p>This app detects and displays a color clicked on an image passed as a parameter. I used the dataset from this project <a href='https://github.com/codebrainz/color-names/blob/master/output/colors.csv'>here</a>.</p><br>

> **4. Speech Emotion Recognition**
>
> > <p>This model recognizes emotions in speech. It uses librosa and an MLPClassifier, and trained on part of the RAVDESS dataset found <a href='https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.YIAp5VMza00'>here</a>, attaining an accuracy of 74%.</p>
